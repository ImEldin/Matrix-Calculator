A comprehensive C++ program designed to perform a variety of matrix operations efficiently.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Matrix Creation**: Supports dynamic creation of matrices of any size.
- **Matrix Operations**:
  - **Addition**: Sum two matrices of the same dimensions.
  - **Subtraction**: Subtract one matrix from another of the same dimensions.
  - **Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices if their dimensions are compatible.
  - **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply any matrix by a scalar value.
  - **Transpose**: Compute the transpose of a given matrix.
  - **Determinant Calculation**: Calculate the determinant of square matrices.
  - **Inverse Calculation**: Compute the inverse of invertible matrices.
- **Error Handling**: Robust checks for invalid operations, such as dimension mismatches or non-invertible matrices.

## ðŸ“œ How to Use

1. **Matrix Input**:
   - Input the matrix elements row by row, separated by ";".
2. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program will perform the selected operation and display the result.
   - For operations like determinant or inverse, ensure the matrix meets the necessary criteria (e.g., being square).

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **C++**: The core programming language used for implementation.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects to model matrices and their operations.
